  "I help startups and businesses turn their AI ideas into reliable, production-ready systems. My work focuses on practical, real-world implementation using RAG pipelines, LLM orchestration and agentic workflows that support real users and daily operations.",
  "In recent projects, I’ve built retrieval systems with PostgreSQL, Redis and pgvector, orchestrated LLMs such as OpenAI, Claude and open-source models within backend logic, developed FastAPI microservices, deployed applications on AWS with Docker, and created clean interfaces using Next.js for end-to-end delivery.",
  "Before freelancing, I worked as an AI Engineer in industrial automation, developing predictive maintenance models, computer vision tools and monitoring dashboards for steel production lines. Working in this environment taught me how to design AI systems that stay stable under noisy data, strict uptime requirements and real operational constraints.",
  "My approach is simple: use LLMs where they bring real value, keep system logic deterministic and observable, and ensure everything remains maintainable long after deployment.",
  "If you’re a business looking to bring AI into real operations, I’d be glad to talk. We can explore your challenges and see how RAG systems, LLMs or agentic workflows could help move your business forward."
