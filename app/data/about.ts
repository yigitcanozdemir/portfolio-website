  "I help startups and businesses turn their AI ideas into reliable, production-ready systems. My focus is on practical, real-world solutions built with RAG pipelines, LLM integration, and agentic workflows that support actual users and day-to-day operations.",
  "Over the past years, I’ve designed retrieval systems with PostgreSQL, Redis and pgvector, integrated LLMs like OpenAI, Claude and open-source models into backend workflows, developed FastAPI services, deployed applications on AWS with Docker and created clean interfaces with Next.js for end-to-end delivery.",
  "Before freelancing, I worked as an AI Engineer in industrial automation where I built predictive maintenance models, computer vision tools and real-time monitoring dashboards for steel production lines. Working in this environment taught me how to design AI systems that stay stable under noisy data, strict uptime requirements and real operational constraints.",
  "My approach is straightforward: use LLMs where they bring real value, keep the core logic deterministic and observable and ensure the system remains maintainable long after deployment.",
  "If you’re a business looking to bring AI into real operations, I’d be glad to talk. We can explore your challenges and see how reliable RAG systems, LLMs or agentic workflows could help move your business forward.",
